Selecting a character from the dropdown box will update the GUI with information for that character.  If you wish to update the task status for connected characters press the refresh button. (Does not live update)


The second drop down is to select which dannet peers group you want displayed


--Group will show only characters in your current group

--Zone will show only characters in your current zone
